## Abstract

Generates html pages that make up a coherent website based on the
data in a file system tree.


## How to get started with treewebber

At first, follow the instructions in INSTALL.

The script is well documented. Read the manual that is available
by calling a script with the `--man` parameter.
Later, using the `--help` option will often suffice because it
gives you a quick overview of the possible options.

To get some quick results it may be a good idea to play a bit with
the enclosed example web. Type something like this and look at the
results in your browser:

`treewebber -v MORE treewebber-example/`

This will show you if treewebber runs flawlessly. I recommend
using the increased verbosity (-v MORE) if you are new to
treewebber because it will show what happens in detail.
