	* treewebber:

	- Instead of doing everything on the fly, now building tree in
	  memory that corresponds to the directory structure and holds all
	  the settings read from the description files. This was a
	  prerequisite for the following changes and those that are
	  planned and not yet implemented.
	- Use @LABEL instead of directory name in navigation bars.
	- New keyword @NAVLABEL to override @LABEL / directory name in
	  navigation bars
	- Adapted manual page
