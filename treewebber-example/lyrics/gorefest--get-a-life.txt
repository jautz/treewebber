GOREFEST -- GET-A-LIFE

Destined to follow
Afraid to miss any trend
The TV is your truth
You just watch and absorb
Never in any doubt
About the message it spreads

You're locked in a mental cage
For the rest of your days
GET-A-LIFE, GET-A-LIFE

Your mind is polluted
With useless information
For a successful career
But you can't handle emotions
Only poor imitations
True intentions have faded

You're locked in a mental cage
For the rest of your days
GET-A-LIFE, GET-A-LIFE

Switch off those pre-sets in your brain
Replace them with life

Just for once think for yourself
And get a life

Lead: Boud

Is it too hard to handle, to deal with the truth!
Is it too hard to handle, to live without rules

You're locked in a mental cage
For the rest of your days
GET-A-LIFE, GET-A-LIFE
