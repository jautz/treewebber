GOREFEST -- Reality - When You Die

The final chapter is finished
The curtain is about to fall
Ending mediocre life
Nothing to be proud of at all
Thinking back now
Despising your self
Feelings oppressed
Always ready to bow
It wasn't real life
Infact just a play
From which, you the actor
Got fired today

Your final walk down the hallway
No applauding masses in here
Not even dead an already forgotten
Your mind is filling with fear
Never any grip on situations
Your life just "passed" you by
And all the sudden it becomes clear
And insanity takes over now

Your not going out with a bang
You won't have your day
Your no longer wanted in this dull play
It wasn't real life
Never came close in a way
Your contract is over
Your finished today

Lead: Frank

And then you die
Part of a generation
Whose minds are all polluted
By the habbit of consumtion
No need to get a life
Everything's been taken care of
Your back bone is attached to strings
In the puppetplay you're part of

No it wasn't real life
It never came close in a way
It's a shame you found out too late
Reality is when you die
